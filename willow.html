            I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
            Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
            And if it was an open-shut case
            I never would've known from that look on your face
            Lost in your current like a priceless wine
            The more that you say
            The less I know
            Wherever you stray
            I follow
            I'm begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
            Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
            As if you were a mythical thing
            Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
            And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
            The more that you say
            The less I know
            Wherever you stray
            I follow
            I'm begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            You know that my train could take you home
            Anywhere else is hollow
            I'm begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
            They count me out time and time again
            Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
            But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
            Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
            Show me the places where the others gave you scars
            Now this is an open-shut case
            Guess I should've known from the look on your face
            Every bait and switch was a work of art
            The more that you say
            The less I know
            Wherever you stray
            I follow
            I'm begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            You know that my train could take you home
            Anywhere else is hollow
            I'm begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            The more that you say
            The less I know
            Wherever you stray
            I follow
            Begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            You know that my train could take you home
            Anywhere else is hollow
            Begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
            Hey, that's my man
            That's my man
            Yeah, that's my man
            Every bait and switch was a work of art
            That's my man
            Hey, that's my man
            I'm begging for you to take my hand
            Wreck my plans
            That's my man
